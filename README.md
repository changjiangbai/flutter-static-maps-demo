# Flutter Static Maps Demo

A sample app showing what you can do with the Google Static Maps API.

Right now, there's no support for Google Maps in Flutter.

But, you can do quite a bit by leveraging [Google's Static Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/static-maps/).

Also uses [Flutter location plugin](https://github.com/Lyokone/flutterlocation)
