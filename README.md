# Flutter Static Maps Demo

A sample app showing what you can do with the Google Static Maps API.

Right now, there's no support for Google Maps in Flutter.

But, you can do quite a bit by leveraging [Google's Static Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/static-maps/).

If you're new to Flutter, [here's an explanation of how to build this](http://ericwindmill.com/zero-to-one-with-flutter-google-maps-app-pt-1). 

Also uses [Flutter location plugin](https://github.com/Lyokone/flutterlocation)
